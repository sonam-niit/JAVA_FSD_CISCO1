It is a BuildTool
Using that we can manage wide range of modules to streamline the development process and also ensure the project built, deployed successfully.

Apache Maven is a project management and building tool.
Following POM Model: Project Object Model

With maven: Project Building, Reporting, Documentation

What is meaning of Builing a Project

--Generate Source Code
-- Generate Documentation from Source Code
--Compile Source Code
--Compile the code packages into its JAR filr
--install the external packages in repository

How to create Maven project in Eclipse
---------------------------------------------
1. Create Java Project


select File --> new --> maven project --> next --> From the catalog dropdown --> select Internal --> Select maven-archtype-quickstart--> next -->
give group id: com.cisco
archtype Id: (Project Name): session-4
see the package name: com.cisco.session4 --> finish

It will create project (If its gives any POP up in console see the project configuration and type Y so the project is geeting generated)

Expand the project and you can see src/main/java here we will add our JAVA Code (by default App.java file must be there with main method)
src/main/test (where you can wrte your Unit Test cases to test your application)
you can see the JRE by default
you can see the available maven dependencies in your project
src folder is showing your java files and test files
target folder is Empty --> if you comppile and package your application it will create JAR file of your Project

POM.XML : Heart of Maven project (provide all configuration details)

	You can add all dependencies, plugins, configuration of your project here.
	Version and snapshot file name also you can change here

--> project --> run as --> maven build --> type in goals : compile package (create JAr)
--> project --> run as --> maven clean (clean target folder_
--> project --> run as --> maven install (do compile, package and build app and provide Jar file)
--> project --> run as --> maven verify --> to verify the project build

Once the snapshot Jar generated you can run project by execting below command in CLI
open the target folder in cmd
>java -cp session4-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.cisco.session4.App

-cp (showing classpath config) means main method class Path
-com.cisco.session4.App (where my main method is located)

(you can see your project output in terminal)

2. Create Web App maven Project
-----------------------------------------

File--> maven project --> next--> catalog:internal --> select webapp archtype --> provile gorupid:com.cisco archtypeId: first-webapp --> package name (com.cisco.first-webapp) --> finish

Webapp by default gives one error to resolve 

open pom.xml and add servlet API dependency

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/javax.servlet-api -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>


Save POM.xml

right click on your project --> maven --> update project and error will remove from the project.
