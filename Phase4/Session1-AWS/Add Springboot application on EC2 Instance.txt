Step 1: 
create Simple Springboot application with only spring web dependency
add one main controller inside the com.cisco.controller folder
@RestController
public class MainController {

	@GetMapping("/")
	public String greeting() {
		return "Good AfterNoon..!!";
	}
	
	@GetMapping("/welcome/{name}")
	public String welcome(@PathVariable String name) {
		return "Welcome "+name;
	}
}

Check the App locally and see the api for / and /welcome is working.

Step 2: Create Jar File
maven clean
maven install

Step 3: creating Amazon EC2 instance, select Ubuntu OS and then connect it with aws cli
	by using ssh command

Step 4: create one folder named java-apps using below command
	>mkdir java-apps

	check its created or not using ls command
	>ls

Step 5: execute logout command to upload jar file on EC2 instance.
	>logout

step 6: Copy your jar file from your project folder and add it to the same location where your .pem file is available.
	scp -i springboot.pem firstapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ubuntu@ec2-18-209-9-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:java-apps

	springboot.pem: key pair file which you have downloaded while creating your instance
	firstapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar: your jar file
	ubuntu@ec2-18-209-9-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com: you instance link you can copy from ssh command
	:java-apps : java-apps is the folder where you want to upload your JAR file

Step 7: again connect using ssh command
	>ssh -i "springboot.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-209-9-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Step 8: You can check uploaded jar file by moving to java-apps folder and execute ls command
	>cd java-apps
	>ls
step 9: if JAR file is uploaded then let's run it, for than install JDK
	>sudo apt update	
	>sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
	It will propmt with installation confirmation type y and enter
	Once installed Check Java Version
	>java -version

step 10: Let's execute Jar File
	>java -jar firstapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
	It will run yoour springboot application and you can see the console like app is running on port 8080.

step 11: to check output browser
	go to your instance copy public Ip and then add port 8080

	192.89.56.10:8080/
	(you can see the output of your Springboo Application)
