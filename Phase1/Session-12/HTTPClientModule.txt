HTTPCLientModule is basically helping us for fetching APIs Data.

Data we are going to fetch in the Form of JSON.

When you trigger the APIs you will get promises. (then or catch, async await)

Observables in Angular

	to use them you need to subscribe.

Using HTTP client we can trigger diffrent types of methods like get, post, put, delete, patch

get: (get all data)
post: (create new data)
put: (update data)
delete delete data
patch: add some new patch to your existing data.

Create App: ng new httpclient
> cd httpclient
> code .
>npm start

Open VS Code and execute below commands

>ng g s services/user --skip-tests
>ng g c users/userlist --skip-tests

create one folder named models and create new file user.model.ts 

export interface User{
    id:number;
    name:string;
    username:string;
    email:string;
    address:Address;
    company:Company;
    phone:string;
    website:string;
}
interface Address{
    street:string;
    suite:string;
    city:string;
    zipcode:string;
}
interface Company{
    name:string;
    catchPhrase:string;
    bs:string;
}

Now open user.service.ts file and add one Base URL for API call.

baseURL:string='https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users';

For API call we required HTTPClientModule so let's import the same in app.module.ts

import {HttpClientModule} from '@angular/common/http';

add in the list of imports:

	imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],

Let's write API calls in user.service.ts

We want to create our own fake server which we can create by just creating a simple JSON and start it with JSON server.

>npm i -g json-server

create one file named products.json

{
	products:[
			{id:1,name:"Headphones",price:499,rating:4.5},
			{id:2,name:"Samsung LED",price:67999,rating:4.7}
		]
}
