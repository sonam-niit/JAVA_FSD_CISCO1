========================================================

How to work with all these databases? for that we required to learn a query langugae which is SQL (structured Query language)
PL SQL (Procedural Language /SQL)

MYSQL is most popular databases.
--> easily access and research data
--> Easily do all data manupulation (DML)
--> Create and change tables (DDL)
--> Fetch Data (DQL)

DDL (Data Defination Language)

	create some structure / alter /drop the databases

DML (Data Manupulation Language)

	insert/update /delete / truncate 

DQL (Data query langugae)
	
	fetch data from Databases
